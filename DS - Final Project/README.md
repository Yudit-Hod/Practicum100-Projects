# Project Description
The telecom operator *Interconnect* would like to be able to forecast their churn of clients. 
If it's discovered that a user is planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special plan options. 
Interconnect's marketing team has collected some of their clientele's personal data, including information about their plans and contracts.

# Data Description
The data consists of files obtained from different sources:
- `contract.csv` — contract information
- `personal.csv` — the client's personal data
- `internet.csv` — information about Internet services
- `phone.csv` — information about telephone services

In each file, the column `customerID` contains a unique code assigned to each client.  
The contract information is valid as of February 1, 2020.
